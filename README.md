## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:**  
   Collects tweets for training and accepts user input for live analysis.

2. **Preprocessing:**  
   Cleans tweets by removing unwanted characters, converting to lowercase, removing stopwords, and applying stemming.

3. **Feature Extraction:**  
   Converts processed text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.

4. **Model Training:**  
   Uses Logistic Regression to classify tweet sentiments based on the extracted features.

5. **Prediction:**  
   Takes user input tweets, preprocesses and vectorizes them, then predicts sentiment with clear, color-coded output.
